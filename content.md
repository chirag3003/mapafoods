## 3. Page: The Process (Our Story)

**Headline:** The Art of Wood-Pressing

* **The Problem with Modern Oils:** Most commercial oils are processed using high heat and chemical solvents, which strip away nutrition.
* **Our Solution:** At māpāfööd, we return to our roots. Our wood-pressing technique generates minimal heat, ensuring that the antioxidants and natural flavors of the seeds remain intact.
* **Spice Crafting:** Our spices are ground carefully to maintain their volatile oils, ensuring that every 50g pack of Turmeric or Chilli Powder is as potent as nature intended.
* **Purity Guarantee:** We manufacture our products in small batches with a strict "No Chemical" policy.
