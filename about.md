### **2. Page Structure & Content**

#### **I. The Hero: Our Identity**

* **Headline:** The Story Behind the Purity.
* **Sub-headline:** Beyond manufacturing, we are on a mission to bring authentic, chemical-free nutrition back to every supper table.
* **Visual Strategy:** A high-resolution image of the wood-pressing unit or the brand logo etched on a natural surface to emphasize the "māpā" (Mother/Earth) connection.

#### **II. The Mission: Returning to Roots**

* **The Problem:** Most modern food is a product of industrial efficiency—utilizing high heat, chemical solvents, and synthetic preservatives.
* **The Solution:** We chose a slower, purer path by returning to traditional wood-pressing and hand-grinding techniques that respect the integrity of every ingredient.

#### **III. The Purity Pact**

* **100% Purity:** We manufacture everything without any preservatives or chemicals.
* **Nutritional Integrity:** By using the traditional "Lakdi Gani" (wood press) method, we prevent heat-related nutrient loss in our oils.
* **Aroma & Potency:** Our spices are ground carefully to preserve the natural volatile oils that give them their medicinal properties.

#### **IV. The "Seed to Supper" Narrative**

* **Seed:** We partner with trusted sources to select high-quality, non-GMO seeds.
* **Process:** Our manufacturing unit is a blend of traditional wisdom and modern hygiene standards.
* **Supper:** We provide the pure building blocks for healthy meals, free from hidden toxins or additives.

#### **V. Future Vision: A Complete Pantry Partner**

* While we started with essential oils and spices, our roadmap includes a full range of chemical-free staples.
* We are expanding into traditional pickles, superfoods like Moringa, and daily staples like Makhana and Chura.

### **3. Design Features**

* **Color Theme:** Utilize **Purity White** for the background to signify cleanliness, with **Forest Green** for headers to represent nature and **Terracotta Orange** for highlighting founding principles.
* **Visual Elements:** Use plenty of white space and large, warm-toned photographs of raw seeds and wooden textures to reinforce the artisanal feel.
* **Showcase Notice:** A clear footer note explaining that this site is a digital gallery of manufacturing capabilities and not an e-commerce platform.
