To create a compelling **Process Page** for **māpāfööd**, we need to tell the story of the "Seed to Supper" journey. Since you are using a clean, sans-serif design, this page should feel like a high-end educational gallery that justifies why your products are superior to mass-produced alternatives.

## **1. Page Objective**

The goal is to provide "proof of purity." You want to explain the **Wood Pressed (Lakdi Gani)** method and your **No-Chemical** philosophy so clearly that the user understands the value without needing to see a price tag.

## **2. Layout Structure: "The Journey"**

### **I. Hero Section: The Promise**

* **Headline:** Crafted by Tradition, Guided by Purity.
* **Sub-headline:** From the fertile soil to your dinner table, we ensure every step of our manufacturing is free from heat, chemicals, and compromises.
* **Visual:** A slow-motion background video or a high-resolution hero image of seeds being hand-sorted.

### **II. Step-by-Step: The "Seed to Supper" Timeline**

*Use a vertical or horizontal timeline with Forest Green lines and Terracotta Orange nodes.*.

1. **Sourcing the Seed:** We partner with local farmers to source high-quality, non-GMO seeds—Mustard, Coconut, Sunflower, and Spices.
2. **Traditional Extraction (The Wood Press):** Our oils are never refined. We use traditional wooden presses that generate zero heat, keeping the vital antioxidants and flavors alive.
3. **Hand-Ground Spices:** Our spices are ground slowly to ensure the natural volatile oils don't evaporate, preserving the aroma and medicinal properties.
4. **Zero-Additive Packaging:** We pack our products in their purest form. No anti-caking agents in your Turmeric, and no preservatives in your Oil.

### **III. The "Science of Purity" Comparison Table**

*A clean table to visually distinguish māpāfööd from industrial brands.*.

| Feature | Industrial Brands | **māpāfööd** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Extraction** | Chemical Solvents & High Heat | **Cold Wood-Pressed (Lakdi Gani)** |
| **Preservatives** | Synthetic Additives (BHA/BHT) | **100% Preservative-Free** |
| **Nutrition** | Stripped during refining | **Natural Nutrients Intact** |
| **Aroma** | Artificial Flavors Added | **Authentic Natural Fragrance** |

## **3. Key Content Blocks**

### **Section: Why Wood Matters**

* **Content:** Wood is a natural insulator. Unlike metal expellers that heat up and oxidize the oil, our wooden gani keeps the process cool. This "Cold Pressing" is the only way to ensure the oil you consume is as healthy as the seed it came from.

### **Section: The No-Chemical Pact**

* **Content:** We manufacture what we eat. Our promise is simple: if it’s a chemical, it’s not in our factory. This applies to our current range of oils and spices, and it will remain the foundation of our future pickles and staples.

---

## **4. Visual & Technical Implementation**

* **Color Usage:** Use **Forest Green** for the "Process" headers and **Terracotta Orange** for the "Purity Icons" (e.g., a "No Chemicals" icon).
* **Font Hierarchy:** **Montserrat Bold** for section titles (e.g., "The Lakdi Gani Method") and **Inter Regular** for the detailed explanations.
* **Interactive Element:** Since you are building a PWA, include a "Scroll-to-Discover" animation where the "Seed" moves down the page and transforms into "Supper" (the final product).
